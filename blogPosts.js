<h1>Finally, a Way to Edit Multiple Events in Google Calendar at Once</h1>
<p>If you’ve ever had your schedule pushed back by an hour (or a day), you already know how annoying Google Calendar can be.</p>
<p>You click one event.<br>Edit. Save.<br>Click the next one.<br>Edit. Save.</p>
<p>Repeat that 15 times and suddenly you’ve wasted 10 minutes doing something that should’ve taken 10 seconds.</p>
<p>That frustration is the reason I built Google Calendar Bulk Edit.</p>
<h2>The Problem I Kept Running Into</h2>
<p>Google Calendar is great for planning. Not so great for changes.</p>
<p>Any time something shifted — a meeting moved, a deadline slipped, a focus block needed to go — I had to manually update every single event. There was no way to grab a group of events and move them together.</p>
<p>Which is weird, because that’s how basically everything else works. Files. Photos. Layers in design tools. You select multiple things and move them.</p>
<p>So why not calendar events?</p>
<h2>What Google Calendar Bulk Edit Does</h2>
<p>This extension adds one simple thing to Google Calendar:</p>
<p><strong>The ability to select multiple events at once.</strong></p>
<p>That’s it.</p>
<p>You click and drag to select events, then move or delete them together. No exporting. No scripts. No complicated setup.</p>
<p>It works directly inside Google Calendar, so it feels natural right away.</p>
<h2>How I Use It Day to Day</h2>
<p>Here are a few real situations where it saves me time:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A meeting gets pushed back → I move my whole afternoon block at once</li>
  <li>I take a day off → I delete all events for that day in seconds</li>
  <li>A project slips → I shift related events forward together</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of fixing my calendar one event at a time, I’m done almost instantly.</p>
<p>And if I mess something up? Undo works like you’d expect.</p>

<p>But if you rely on it daily, this helps a lot.</p>
