<h1>Finally, a Way to Edit Multiple Events in Google Calendar at Once</h1>
<p>If you’ve ever had your schedule pushed back by an hour (or a day), you already know how annoying Google Calendar can be.</p>
<p>You click one event.<br>Edit. Save.<br>Click the next one.<br>Edit. Save.</p>
<p>Repeat that 15 times and suddenly you’ve wasted 10 minutes doing something that should’ve taken 10 seconds.</p>
<p>That frustration is the reason I built Google Calendar Bulk Edit.</p>
<h2>The Problem I Kept Running Into</h2>
<p>Google Calendar is great for planning. Not so great for changes.</p>
<p>Any time something shifted — a meeting moved, a deadline slipped, a focus block needed to go — I had to manually update every single event. There was no way to grab a group of events and move them together.</p>
<p>Which is weird, because that’s how basically everything else works. Files. Photos. Layers in design tools. You select multiple things and move them.</p>
<p>So why not calendar events?</p>
<h2>What Google Calendar Bulk Edit Does</h2>
<p>This extension adds one simple thing to Google Calendar:</p>
<p><strong>The ability to select multiple events at once.</strong></p>
<p>That’s it.</p>
<p>You click and drag to select events, then move or delete them together. No exporting. No scripts. No complicated setup.</p>
<p>It works directly inside Google Calendar, so it feels natural right away.</p>
<h2>How I Use It Day to Day</h2>
<p>Here are a few real situations where it saves me time:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A meeting gets pushed back → I move my whole afternoon block at once</li>
  <li>I take a day off → I delete all events for that day in seconds</li>
  <li>A project slips → I shift related events forward together</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of fixing my calendar one event at a time, I’m done almost instantly.</p>
<p>And if I mess something up? Undo works like you’d expect.</p>
<h2>Who This Is Actually Useful For</h2>
<p>If you use Google Calendar casually, you might not notice the problem.</p>
<p>But if you rely on it daily, this helps a lot.</p>
<p>It’s especially useful for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>People with meeting-heavy schedules</li>
  <li>Students managing classes and study blocks</li>
  <li>Developers and creators planning focused work time</li>
  <li>Anyone who frequently reschedules things</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, if your calendar changes often, this removes a ton of friction.</p>
<h2>It’s Intentionally Simple</h2>
<p>I didn’t want to build another bloated productivity tool.</p>
<p>Google Calendar Bulk Edit doesn’t try to do everything. It just:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lets you select multiple events</li>
  <li>Move or delete them together</li>
  <li>Undo if needed</li>
  <li>Customize shortcuts and colors if you want</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s all it needs to do.</p>
<h2>Why I Think This Should’ve Existed Already</h2>
<p>Once you use bulk editing, going back feels slow in a way that’s hard to ignore.</p>
<p>It’s one of those features that makes you wonder why it wasn’t part of Google Calendar in the first place.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever thought “there has to be a faster way to do this”, you’re probably right.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Your calendar shouldn’t fight you every time plans change.</p>
<p>Google Calendar Bulk Edit makes rescheduling feel quick and painless instead of tedious. If you’re constantly adjusting your schedule, it’s a small tool that saves a surprising amount of time.</p>
<p>That’s really it.</p>
